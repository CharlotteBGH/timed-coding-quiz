# Timed Coding Quiz 
## Description
For this task, I had to create an interactive, timed coding quiz that mirrors the style of quiz I may have to complete as part of the front-end developer interview process. 
The multiple-choice quiz runs in a browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript code. 
Its purpose is to allow students to answers on JavaScript fundamentals and store their scores so they can check their progress against that of their peers. 

## How it works 
When the start button is clicked, a timer starts and the user is presented with a question. When the user answers the question, another is presented. If a question is entered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer in the top-right of the screen. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over. When the game is over, the user can save their initials and score.

## Usage
To try out the quiz for yourself, just click 'Start Quiz' and answer the questions when prompted. You can see the timer in the top-left of the screen. For each question, you will be notified if you have answered correctly or incorrectly. At the end, you will be presented with your score and asked to insert your initials to save your score.
